	<description>&lt;b&gt;Doesn't break saves!&lt;/b&gt;
Tired of raids not happening? Are you not getting ANY at all raids and also not getting any log errors? Raids are very easy to mess up by mod conflicts and it's almost impossible to troubleshoot or fix raid occurence problems when this happens, even if you know which mod is causing the conflict. There are certain mods I personally can't play this game without bugs or not so I made this mod to counter the problem.

It works exactly like my Trade Ships No Matter What mod except it makes there be raids no matter what. The storyteller, other game mechanics and other mods have no say whatsoever over raids generated by this mod, making it virtually impossible to get broken by other mods or game mechanics.

Note that this mod does not interfere or disable normal game raids in any way. Adding it to your game will increase the frequency of normal raids depending on what you configure the settings to in the mod settings menu.</description>
